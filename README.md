7 - Launch the game, go into settings, graphics settings, and turn terrain scatters ON and set their density to 100%
  - THIS STEP IS CRUCIAL! IF YOU WANT TO SEE FLOATING ISLANDS AND COOL TERRAIN FEATURES, THIS MUST BE TURNED ON!
  - PERFORMANCE HIT IS MINIMAL AND HAS BEEN OPTIMIZED FOR ALL SYSTEMS

8 - In the same graphics settings page, turn the terrain quality up until you see "BeyondHome - LOW/MED/HIGH".
  - The "HIGH" preset is RECOMMENDED, even for lower end systems, but if you really are struggling, turn it down.
  - This setting governs overall terrain quality and the range at which you render scatters.
  
9 - Launch the game and make a new save! I hope you enjoy playing Beyond Home.
