	The terrain portion of the changelog is tiny but it has the biggest changes on the planets. So, yeah
	Well done for reading this far by the way, it's probably incredibly boring.
	I spent the longest time on the terrain textures, bloody difficult they are!
	
- Visuals:
	- Re-enabled spherical mesh for some scatterer bodies since it would cause the clouds to light up in the dark
	- Created a 16k cloud texture and two 8k textures for main clouds
	- Created 3 gas giant textures for Gateway and Janus
	- Created aurora textures for Gateway, Rhode, Tau, etc
		
- Optimization:
	- Removed unused scatters
	- Removed unused textures
	- Removed unused MTL files
	- Reduced some biome map resolutions
	- Enabled GPU Instancing for scatters, but unsure if it works or not. Better performance for low end CPUs
	- Reduced layer volume for EVE clouds and increased the size instead
	- Reduced some planets' scatter render distances
	
- Other:
	- Added installation checker. Source code on Github because SkWoD SAyS So
	- Added new Skybox
