	@RESULTS
	{
		default = Looks like you don't get a special sarcastic science report for this planet. Think yourself lucky, you might have cut yourself on that edge.
		
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Rhode, eh? Looks pretty desert-ed! Ha. There should be a portal device to your le- wait no, wrong script.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Planes are cool and all, but are you gonna, yknow, SET OFF?
		KerbinSrfLandedVAB = Of all the places to go, you chose to go here. Well isn't that just fantastic. Did you expect some special flavour text?
		KerbinSrfLandedSPH = You could be out there furthering our knowledge of the stars and you decided to pitch up to the front door? Fine, have it your way.
		KerbinSrfLanded = You've not even set off yet. Or have you just got back? Either way, what are you sitting around for?
		KerbinSrfLanded = Yup. Sure looks like sand here. I'm not sure what else you expected, to be honest.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Cacti, trees, the occasional oddly shaped rock. Feels like home.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Mmmmmmmmmmmm. Smell that? That's a different kind of wind. Ew.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The view is rather nice from up here, but was it really necessary to look down?
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The view is even nicer from here. Don't tell me we're going even further up?
		KerbinInSpaceLow = SPACE! Not really the final frontier since Kerbals have been here before. Are we there yet?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = I can see... Lua? Ash? And I think that one there is Armstrong. Oh. My bad. THERE'S NO WINDOWS.
		
		LuaSrfLanded = The MOON! What a wonderful place. I heard that there were cool colonizing devices in the mountains.
		LuaSrfLanded = The postcards that I was sent made this place look a whole lot nicer than it does.
		LuaSrfLanded = It's a bit warm in here, I might open a window for some fresh air.
		LuaFlyingLow = Spotted any of those colonizers yet? Me neither.
		LuaFlyingHigh = "Flying high at Lua"? Nice one, the atmosphere is only 10km. What is this, an atmosphere for ants?
